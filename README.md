# Stu-Info-Management

The Student Information Management System is a practice 
for my C Programming learning. It uses the linked list
for data-storing. And has a lot of features:  

* A command-line console for operating
* Easy-to-use commands
* Users can `add`, `remove` and `sort` the information
* Information is available for exporting into a
  text-based file presented in a nice table.
