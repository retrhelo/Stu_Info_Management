# Stu-Info-Management
=====================

It is originally a practice from my C Programming Course. I was
asked to programme a student information control system, which 
is supposed to add, remove, check out, edit, and export student 
information. 

Stu-Info-Management is using the `linked list` structure, which 
is the request from my course. 

All the sources files are in the C language.
